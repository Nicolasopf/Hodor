## Web scrapping

Web scrapping is mostly used to find information in a WebSite, such as names, emails, etc. Also, this simulate an human navigating in the Website, being able to register, login, etc.

In this project, I will vote X times in an specific site for my ID (2187) in a basic website voting.
